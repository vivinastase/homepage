I am currently a research associate in the <a href="https://clcl.unige.ch/">Computational Learning and Computational Linguistics (CLCL)</a> group at the University of Geneva, and part of the <a href="https://evolvinglanguage.ch/">NCCR Evolving language</a>.

With my friend Rada, we wrote some children's books about word etymologies:

      </a>
     The book contains etymologies for about 50 frequently used English words, to illustrate how creative people, in this case about language, and how interesting and sometimes funny the stories of words are. If you are curious, here is the <a href="TSoaW_index.png">index</a>, and <a href="The%20Story%20of%20a%20Word%20-%20Sample%20Pages.ss.pdf">a few pages</a>.

      The book contains etymologies for about 50 frequently used Romanian words -- in Romanian.   If you are curious, here is the <a href="TSoaW_index_ro.png">index</a>, and <a href="PovesteaUnuiCuvant_sample.pdf">a few pages</a>.
