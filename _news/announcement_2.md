As member of <a href="https://scifilmit.com/">SciFilmIt</a>, together with the <a href="http://clujshorts.ro/persona-association/">Associatia Persona</a> from Cluj-Napoca (Romania), we organized two events for making short films in 2024:
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://scifilmit.com/cluj-napoca-2024/">the workshop in April</a> a group of pupils from the National Coolege George Cosbuc in Cluj-Napoca made very fun and informative short films on 5 topics, as an active learning activity.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://scifilmit.com/cluj-napoca-december-2024/">the workshop in December</a>, we had participants form three universities in Cluj-Napoca -- the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinaryr Medicine (USAMV), University Babes-Bolyai (UBB), The National Music Academy "Gheorghe Dima" (ANMGD) -- who combined their expertise to created short films about the research at USAMV</li>
