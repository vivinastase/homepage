The short film festival <a href="https://clujshorts.ro/">Cluj Shorts</a> will take place between April 10 - 13 in Cluj-Napoca. This year it has an AI theme, with talks and discussion about AI in general, and AI in cinema.

I will give a talk about Large Language Models and AI on Saturday, April 12th, 18:30 at the Casino.
